/**
 * Centralised order money math: shipping fee + tax on top of the (already

 * deployment without code changes. All rates default to 0 / disabled, so an
 * existing install behaves exactly as before until configured.
 *
 *   TAX_RATE                 e.g. 0.08  (8% applied to subtotal)
 *   SHIPPING_FLAT_FEE        e.g. 5     (flat shipping charge)
 *   FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD  e.g. 100   (subtotal >= threshold ships free; 0 = off)
